		<h3>Event Coverage</h3>
		<p><b>Event coverage videos are a great way to cover a whole event or create an entertaining highlight package of the event.</b></p>
		<p>We have covered many different types of events, including product launches, business seminars, awards ceremonies and promotional events. The beauty is that the events can be accessed and watched from anywhere in the world, so they can be enjoyed and experienced by anyone, including those that were not originally on the guest list.</p>
		<p>Having an impressive event video can help you advertise/promote the next event you are planning.</p>
		<p>The team at White Horse Productions don't just film the event itself, we interview you about your passion behind the event to ensure that we are on the same page and communicate the right messages and themes in your video. The shoot captures the film setup, the behind the scenes moments and the hard work that led up to make the event spectacular. Once the shoot is wrapped, our expert editors get to work on piecing together the coverage of your special event.</p>
